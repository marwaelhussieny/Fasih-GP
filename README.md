## what is this?

this is **fasih**. an AI-powered platform for the arabic language that we built because nothing like it existed.

we're computer science students who grew up reading arabic poetry, struggling with grammar rules, and wishing there was a modern way to learn and explore our language. so we made one.

think duolingo meets GPT, but designed specifically for arabic. with actual linguistic depth. and a community that cares.

## the core idea

### إعربلي (i'rabli) - the heart of everything

write any word in any text. our AI instantly gives you:
- complete grammatical breakdown (إعراب)
- word roots and morphology (الصرف)
- rhetorical devices (البلاغة)

no more flipping through 5 different books. no more confusion. just instant, accurate linguistic analysis.

### gamified learning that doesn't suck

we hate boring education apps. so we made learning arabic actually fun:
- real-time quiz battles
- streak systems that work
- achievements that mean something
- leaderboards with your friends
- adaptive difficulty (AI adjusts to YOUR level)

### a real library

classical poetry. modern literature. research papers. all searchable. all analyzed. all accessible.

our search isn't just keyword matching - it understands *meaning*. search for "longing" and find verses about حنين even if that exact word isn't there.

### write, share, engage

publish your articles. get real feedback from the community. participate in writing challenges. 

this isn't just a learning app. it's a space for arabic language enthusiasts to actually exist together.

## tech we used (and why)

**flutter** → because we needed it to feel smooth and look beautiful across all devices

**firebase + node.js** → real-time features needed real-time infrastructure

**postgresql** → arabic text is complex. we needed a database that could handle it

**custom NLP models** → generic AI doesn't understand arabic grammar deeply enough. we trained our own

**google cloud vision** → OCR that actually works with arabic script

**google speech API** → pronunciation feedback has to be accurate

## team

we're 5 computer science students from the Higher Technological Institute who decided to spend our graduation year building something we actually believe in.

| Rahma Hafez |  Backend development 
| Malak Hossam | AI/ML engineering
| Marwa Elhussieny |  flutter development


## what's next

**current state:** under construction 

**immediate priorities:**
- offline mode
- more sophisticated AI models
- live tutoring integration
- dialect support

**dream features:**
- AR vocabulary learning
- voice-based conversations with AI tutor
- collaborative real-time writing
- academic research tools

## why this matters

arabic is spoken by 400+ million people. it has a literary tradition spanning over 1500 years. some of humanity's greatest poetry, philosophy, and science was written in arabic.

but modern learning tools treat it like any other language. they don't understand its complexity, its depth, its beauty.

we built fasih because we think arabic deserves better.

this started as a graduation project. but it became something more personal. every feature we added, we asked ourselves: "would this help someone truly understand and love arabic?"

## contributing

if you care about arabic, if you code, if you have ideas - we'd love to hear from you.

open an issue. submit a PR. start a discussion.

just be genuine and respectful to the language.

## license

MIT License - do whatever you want with this code.

but if you build something cool with it, let us know. we'd love to see it.
